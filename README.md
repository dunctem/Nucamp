# JonD's Nucamp Git Repository
###  Intro
I will be adding notes, assignments and other related material documenting my journey through 22 weeks of intense full stack developer bootcamp provided by [Nucamp](https://nucamp.co). 

### Minimum requirements
Assuming you have Git already installed, you will still need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed properly on your computer. I found [this guide](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html) very useful.

### Instructions
To run the test environment follow this **step-by-step** guide.

#### Step 1
Open your terminal and clone the git repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/dunctem/Nucamp.git`

#### Step 2
When git has finished downloading the required files, you will need to run the installation script with this command:

`npm install`
or
`npm i` for short

#### Step 3
After the installation process you are now ready to run the testing environment with:

`npm start`

It will compile for a second or two and launch the server on http://localhost:3000 and automatically open it on your default browser.
